# Methodologies

To perform a penetration test, it is necessary to follow a methodology. This ensures that no attack vector is overlooked and that the work can be validated and recognized by other professionals. It is considered good practice to state which methodology has been followed when conducting a penetration test, as it facilitates future re-tests and provides overall consistency to the final results.

Below is an overview of the most widely used methodologies in the information security industry, developed through collaboration among professionals from different countries.

## OSSTMM

The OSSTMM standard (Open Source Security Testing Methodology) is one of the most widely recognized standards in the industry, providing a scientific methodology for network penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. This methodology is based on the tester’s in-depth knowledge and experience, as well as on human intelligence to interpret the identified vulnerabilities and their potential impact within the network.

## OWASP

For everything related to application security, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is the most widely recognized standard in the cybersecurity industry. This methodology, driven by a highly skilled community that stays up to date with the latest technologies, has helped countless organizations mitigate application vulnerabilities.

## PTES

PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) highlights the most recommended approach for structuring a penetration test. This standard guides professionals through the various stages of a penetration test, including initial communication, information gathering, and threat modeling phases.
