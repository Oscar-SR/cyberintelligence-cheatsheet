# Tools

## Browser

Browsers designed for the Dark Web provide access to hidden services while preserving anonymity and operational security. Unlike conventional browsers, these tools route traffic through privacy-focused networks, prevent fingerprinting and tracking, and often include security configurations specifically tailored for navigating sites safely.

## Vertical search engines

Vertical search engines focus on a specific type of data or domain, offering deeper and more specialized results than general-purpose search engines. In OSINT, they are essential for reducing information overload and retrieving high-signal data such as exposed services, images, social media content, or historical web snapshots.
